# Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis

This project analyzes retail sales data to identify regional performance differences, high-value customer segments, seasonal demand patterns, and product profitability trends.

## Key Insights

- The **West region** drives the highest revenue, while the **South lags** significantly.
- **Technology** is the top revenue category, but **some furniture sub-categories generate negative profit**.
- **Labels, Paper, and Envelopes** deliver **exceptionally high profit margins** and should be prioritized.
- A small group of customers are responsible for a disproportionate share of revenue â†’ **retention matters more than broad acquisition**.
- Sales consistently **peak in Q3 and Q4**, indicating strong seasonal demand cycles.

## Why This Matters

This analysis highlights which parts of the business actually make money, which lose money, and where strategic focus should shift. Improving pricing strategy on low-margin categories, promoting high-margin consumables, and retaining top customers would directly improve profitability.
